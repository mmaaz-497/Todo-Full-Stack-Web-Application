# Specification Quality Checklist: Authentication Session Endpoint & Sign-Up Validation Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All validation criteria met. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Strengths:
- Clear separation of concerns with 3 prioritized user stories (2 P1, 1 P2)
- 14 functional requirements covering all critical aspects
- 8 measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Well-defined assumptions and out-of-scope items

### Notes:
- Specification correctly avoids implementation details while being specific about requirements
- All user stories include acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes rather than technical metrics
- Edge cases address important failure scenarios that need consideration during planning
